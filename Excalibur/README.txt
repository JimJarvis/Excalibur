Jarvis Initiative :: project Excalibur
The state-of-the-art chess engine.

The silent war storms the enchanted board
The lonely warrior wields the sacred sword
Behold! A symphony of black and white
Echoes a millennium of masters' might
Let wisdom inspire us in the glorious test
May Excalibur bless us on the lofty quest
