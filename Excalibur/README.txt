Jarvis Initiative :: project Excalibur
The state-of-the-art chess engine.

The silent war storms the enchanted board
The lonely warrior wields the sacred sword
Behold! A symphony of black and white
Echoing centuries of masters' might
Let wisdom guide you in the glorious test
May Excalibur bless you on the lofty quest
