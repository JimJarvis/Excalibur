Jarvis Initiative :: Project Excalibur
A pretty good chess engine.

(c)2013  Jim Fan

The silent war storms the enchanted board
The lonely warrior wields the sacred sword
Behold! A symphony of black and white
Echoes a millennium of masters' might
Let wisdom inspire us in the glorious test
May Excalibur bless us on the lofty quest


Hope you enjoy my thematic poem for the engine.


========================== History ==========================

In fall 2012, I decided to pursue a career in artificial intelligence, a branch of computer science that I deeply enjoy. Yet a college freshman, I thought of doing a personal project that can help polish my skills as well as keep my passion high. 

After a long time of hard trials to map out a plan, I accidentally came to revisit one of the ancient ambitions way back in my childhood. In those good old days, 64 squares of black and white were more than enough to trap my little mind in fascination. 
Unfortunately, however, I was perhaps one of the least talented chess players in the world. Grandpa was my first and only trainer, but I never came close to beating him even when he played handicap (say, playing without a bishop).

That unfulfilled wish emerged from years of dust and finally secured my plan for the summer. In May 2013, I launched the project and set off on a journey to challenge myself with the "crown jewel" of artificial intelligence: chess. 
I named my engine after the sacred sword of King Arthur, the legendary British king who led his knights to countless victories against foreign invaders.
And that's how Excalibur was born.
