// so as to value victim more than aggress. E.g., NxQ > RxQ > NxR > NxB > PxB
// Suprisingly, this appears to perform slightly better than SEE based
// move ordering. The reason is probably that in a position with a winning
// capture, capturing a more valuable (but sufficiently defended) piece
// first usually doesn't hurt. The opponent will have to recapture, and
// the hanging piece will still be hanging (except in the unusual cases
// where it is possible to recapture with the hanging piece). Exchanging
// big pieces before capturing a hanging piece probably helps to reduce
// the subtree size.
// In main search we want to push captures with negative SEE values to
// badCaptures[] array, but instead of doing it now we delay till when
// the move has been selected, this way we save
// some SEE calls in case we get a cutoff (idea from Pablo Vazquez).
